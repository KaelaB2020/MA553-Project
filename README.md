This is the sequential version of the project. It is written exclusively in  C++.
This script is essentially a rewriting of the 1999 MATLAB code written by O. Sigmund 
on topology optimization of a 2-D simply supported beam in C++. This sequential code
is meant as a stepping stone towards a parallel version of itself to be implemented
using MPI.
